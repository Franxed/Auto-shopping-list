# Auto-shopping-list
Automatic Foodstock tracker, shopping list generator with SQL Databases. [(Python),(sqlite3)]

Hello, in this code I am creating a program which will keep track of stock (food). You'll type in what you have and set the threshold or minimum amount of items inside pantry/cabinet.
This will update or create a database called 'Groceries_Database' database file.
If a item falls below threshold of specific item, it should automatically upload or update another database/list called Shopping_list. 
Generating the items needed to shop or creating a shopping list which you don't have to make.
