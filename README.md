Aspects of this code:

This code manages a grocery inventory using an SQLite database, including functionalities for adding/updating items, 
removing items, and automatically maintaining a shopping list based on stock levels. 
The code interacts with two main tables: Foodstock and Shopping_list.

The database initialization creates the Foodstock table to store items, their quantities, and minimum required quantities 
and the Shopping_list table to track items that need to be purchased, linked to Foodstock by item ID.

The update_foodstock function inserts a new item or updates an existing item in the Foodstock table, 
ensuring that the item’s quantity is correctly updated and printing a success message. 
It also calls update_shopping_list to adjust the shopping list based on the current quantity.

The remove_foodstock function deletes an item from the Foodstock table and prints a success message after the removal.

The update_shopping_list function checks the current quantity of an item in Foodstock, 
adding the item to Shopping_list if its quantity is below the minimum 
and removing the item from Shopping_list if its quantity meets or exceeds the minimum.

The view_shopping_list function retrieves and returns items from the Shopping_list, 
joined with item names from Foodstock, while the view_foodstock function retrieves and returns all items from the Foodstock table.

The main function provides a text-based interface for users to interact with the program, 
offering options to update/add items, remove items, view the shopping list, view the foodstock, and exit the program.

The code uses SQLite, which is efficient for small to medium-sized databases typical for personal or small business use. 
Operations are performed using SQL commands, ensuring that data is stored and retrieved quickly.

In terms of functionality, users can add new items or update existing items in the Foodstock, with the system ensuring that the item’s quantity 
and minimum quantity are updated accordingly. When an item’s quantity falls below the minimum, it’s added to the Shopping_list. 
Conversely, if the quantity meets or exceeds the minimum, it’s removed from the Shopping_list. Users can remove items from the Foodstock, 
which helps in managing the inventory effectively. 
They can also view the current state of the inventory (Foodstock) and the items that need to be purchased (Shopping_list).

This script provides a robust solution for managing a grocery inventory, ensuring that stock levels are maintained, 
and shopping needs are dynamically updated based on predefined thresholds. 
The user-friendly menu makes it easy to interact with the inventory system, making it suitable for personal use or small businesses.
